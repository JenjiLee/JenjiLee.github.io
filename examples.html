        <h2>PROJECTS AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <h3>Image Coloring System Based on Deep Learning <i>(Jan 2019 - Present)</i></h3>
        <p><i>Project leader, Instructed by Yinfeng Li, Associate Professor, School of Electrical Engineering, Xidian University, China<br /></i>
        <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            Searched relevant documents of the project and produced more than 90,000 Data sets for the Chinese market(the 1960s--1980s), restoring the texture of the old domestic films.
        </li>
        <li>
            Designed a model based on the GANS, through data learning, achieved the purpose of coloring pictures in different scene accurately.     
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Intelligent Tableware Recycling Robot Arm <i>(Jan 2019 - Apr 2019) </i></h3>
      <p><i>Advised by Guangzhong Yang, Professor, School of The Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London, England<br /></i>
      <ul type="disc">
      <li>
          Utilized the mechanism of self-perceived coordinates, directly obtained the position information of the robot arm based on computer vision and machine learning, which reduced the commissioning cost of the arm.
      </li>
      <li>
          Applied point cloud map to achieve coordinate data visualization, solved the problem in accurate value measurements, depending on the angle and length, truly realized the fully automatic operation.
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Heat Conduction of Heat-proof Clothing<i>(Sep 2018 - Nov 2018)</i></h3>
      <p><i>leader, Instructed by Shuisheng Zhou, Professor, School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University, China<br /></i>
      <ul type="disc">
      <li>
          Designed the mathematical model of heat-proof clothing with the partial differential equation learned.
      </li>
      <li>
          Applied Matlab to solve the main parameters of the heat conduction model and draw an image of heat transfer.
       <li>
          Achieved the relative errors of 5% and 6% on the thickness of general fire-proof clothing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>A System for Clothing Management based Deep Learning<i>(May 2018 - Jun 2019)</i></h3>
    <p><i>Advised by Ning Lu, Assistant Professor, School of Electrical Engineering, Xidian University, China<br /></i>
    <ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Developed an app based on CNN network for intelligent collocation, combining with the weather and user's emotion, which could assist individuals to match clothes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Installed a microelectronic chip on the clothes to complete the collection of basic information such as the model number, material, and purchase time.
     <li>
        Applied RFID to send information to sensors on the closet and control data through the sensor and mobile APP.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>A System for Clothing Management based Deep Learning<i>(May 2018 - Jun 2019)</i></h3>
  <p><i>Instructed by ShuYuan Yang, Professor, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, China<br /></i>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>
      Modified the original algorithm(based on the identification of ORB feature points, with high accuracy and high efficiency).
    </li>
  <li>
      Increased the map saving and loading functions, enables it more suitable for practical application scenarios.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h2>

  
    <h4>Leaded Classmates to Explore School Landforms with UAV<i>(Feb 2019 - Apr 2019)</i></h4>
  <p>
