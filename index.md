Application Number: CN201910234202.5

## PROJECTS & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
### Image Coloring System Based on Deep Learning（*Jan 2019 - Present*）
*Project leader, Instructed by Yinfeng Li, Associate Professor, School of Electrical Engineering, Xidian University, China*
- Searched relevant documents of the project and produced more than 90,000 Data sets for the Chinese market(the 1960s--1980s), restoring the texture of the old domestic films.
- Designed a model based on the GANS, through data learning, achieved the purpose of coloring pictures in different scene accurately.

### Intelligent Tableware Recycling Robot Arm（*Jan 2019 - Apr 2019*）
*Advised by Guangzhong Yang, Professor, School of The Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London, England*
- Utilized the mechanism of self-perceived coordinates, directly obtained the position information of the robot arm based on computer vision and machine learning, which reduced the commissioning cost of the arm.
- Applied point cloud map to achieve coordinate data visualization, solved the problem in accurate value measurements, depending on the angle and length, truly realized the fully automatic operation.

### Heat Conduction of Heat-proof Clothing(*Sep 2018 - Nov 2018*)
*leader, Instructed by Shuisheng Zhou, Professor, School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University, China*
- Designed the mathematical model of heat-proof clothing with the partial differential equation learned.
- Applied Matlab to solve the main parameters of the heat conduction model and draw an image of heat transfer.
- Achieved the relative errors of 5% and 6% on the thickness of general fire-proof clothing.

### A System for Clothing Management based Deep Learning(*May 2018 - Jun 2019*)
*Advised by Ning Lu, Assistant Professor, School of Electrical Engineering, Xidian University, China*
- Developed an app based on CNN network for intelligent collocation, combining with the weather and user's emotion, which could assist individuals to match clothes.
- Installed a microelectronic chip on the clothes to complete the collection of basic information such as the model number, material, and purchase time.
- Applied RFID to send information to sensors on the closet and control data through the sensor and mobile APP.

### Vision-based Automatic Driving Express Robot(*Apr 2017 - Aug 2018*)
*Instructed by ShuYuan Yang, Professor, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, China*
- Modified the original algorithm(based on the identification of ORB feature points, with high accuracy and high efficiency) .
- Increased the map saving and loading functions, enables it more suitable for practical application scenarios.
